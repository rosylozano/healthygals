      Birth control is a method used by women around the world to prevent pregnancy primarily. However, it has become more common for young women to take birth control to lighten period symptoms and for overall health. Regardless of the reason to take these contraceptives, it is important to take into consideration one's own personal physical and mental health before deciding on a method. Consult with your doctor on the best option for you

        <ol>
        <h4><li> The Pill </li></h4>
          <p>

          This method is worn on the skin of your upper arm, belly, back, or butt. A new patch must be placed every week for 3 weeks. 1 week without the patch is fine, but you must repeat the cycle right after. This method prevents pregnancy by stopping sperm from meeting an egg. It contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, which are similar to some our bodies make naturally. By placing the patch on certain places of the body, hormones are absorbed through the skin.
